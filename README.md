Triple Graph based Metadata storage - TriGraM

A brief history
---------------

The original motivation is described in
[my thesis](http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10487-1012268216.htm).

Preliminary version was developed as a simple XQuery program during 2011.2\~2011.8,
and can be run from [XQilla](http://xqilla.sourceforge.net/HomePage) command line,
the input source file is from [DMTF CIM](http://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim) model
and must be compiled by OpenPegasus, and the basic idea is to use translated
semantic model in helping storage resource management.

In late 2011, switch the whole tool-chain to Python and
[RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) for flexible development,
called SEED, aims at efficient metadata storage for distributed file
systems.

In late 2012, considering the scalability issues, the main framework
switched once more, to [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) +
[Jena](http://jena.apache.org/), for an easy integration with
[TDB](http://jena.apache.org/documentation/tdb/).

### SEED

Storage of **Extemporal Ensemble Device**

Organize commodity storage devices with minimum cost to build a
loose-coupled system, which features dynamic
metadata-manager/storage-server/client nodes, and fast deployment.

How to use
----------

1.  deploy [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki) with
    [sbteclipse](https://github.com/typesafehub/sbteclipse), open sbt
    console in project root directory, type `update`, wait until all the
    dependencies are resolved.

2.  use `eclipse` to generate eclipse project, include `.project` and
    `.classpath`.

3.  use `compile` or `package`.

4.  use `copy-dependencies` to collect all jars into `target\scala-2.10\lib\`.

5.  use loaders in "bin" to execute, `trigram` for \*NIX and
    `trigram.cmd` for Windows.

6.  use `translator` to translate various resources to semantic models,
    the models can then be imported into trigram.

    translate cim model first, for that will be used in other computer system models.

    * CIM_All.owl: all-in-one version, complete huge model.

    * CIM_Base.owl ...: model group, which contains separate, dependent sub-models
      for use by dedicated modelers, can be imported when required.

    models can then be imported by `trigram -i <model>`.

    models generated by CimSchemaEx, imported by application models, can be gathered
    by `cim-model-merger`.

    The purpose is to merge required sub-models into one aggregated model.
    The merged model can than be easily inferred, imported or transferred.

    The merge is decided by sub-model dependency implied by owl:import.
    After the merge process, all the owl:import will be cleaned.

    To compare with models based on complete CIM model: CIM_All.owl.
    The output model could be significantly smaller.

7.  SPARQL execution

    * use `trigram -q <SPARQL query>` for query, `trigram -u <SPARQL update>` for update.

    * or use `trigram` to enter command shell, and mode <query|update> to
      switch between query and update modes.

NOTE:

1.  the loaders will search dependencies in `target\scala-2.10\lib\` (step 4).

2.  The sbt ivy cache should be located in a folder without spaces in its name.

3.  ivy cache relocation can be done through adding these parameters to
    sbt loader:

    JAVA\_OPTS=" -Dsbt.ivy.home=d:/java/sbt/.ivy2/
    -Dsbt.global.base=d:/java/sbt/.sbt/ "\$JAVA\_OPTS
